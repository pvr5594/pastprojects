Assignment 1: Read Me

1. Time Spent on the Assignment:
	I spent the better part of a week on the assignment. Due to various circumstances, I had to ask for permission to submit this assignment late. I did spend 

2. Assignment Problem Areas:
	The biggest problem area was when I tried to formulate my own solution to this problem. It ended up being a mess for various reasons, the main one being that while I understood how individual lines of code worked, I had a tough time envisioning the how to construct the overarching program to calculate the Armstrong Numbers. Thus, I ended up following the example presented by Tom in the class, almost entirely. I did make sure to learn exactly how each line of code functioned individually and how they worked as a whole. I believe that I now have a better understanding regarding how to approach Python code thanks to this assignment. 

3. Shortcomings in the Solution:
	As mentioned earlier, I had a tough time attempting this assignment on my own. I wanted to try doing so without any help, and it helped me understand how much I was lacking in my understanding and how much I must work to improve in the future. I hope to attempt this assignment again but use a different method to do so, just to see if I can. 

4. Extra Credit:
	i. Integer Extra Credit:
	Using the (.isnumeeric) line of code, I followed Tom’s example from class to make sure only integers can be entered. Strings and numbers with decimal points provides an error message and a prompt to retry.
